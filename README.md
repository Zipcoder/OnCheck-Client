## Synopsis

OnCheck is an app that combines the networking power of social media, the ability to search for your favorite restaurants in Delaware, and years of inspection data into a powerful source for good - for your stomach and your peace of mind.

## Motivation

We found that, while you can see what people think of restaurants in your area, most review apps or websites don't provide any baseline for their users or use the data that is provided by the State of Delaware for the benefit of users. We wanted to fill that gap.
